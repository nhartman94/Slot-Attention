# README

**Goal:** Slot atttention for clustering studies. There are a lot of notebooks while brainstorming what the issues might be, but some of the experiments are (in ~ reverse chronological order):

## Notebooks

Exploratory data analysis for looking at some notebooks for these problems.

## Code

The useful functions that are used across notebooks are in the `code repo`, and I started submitting trainings to batch systems too.

Also, the output of models and figures plotting performance through the training time are getting saved here as well.
